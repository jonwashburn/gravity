/-- The field equation reduces to Newtonian gravity in the weak field limit. -/

  intro h_weak
  -- In weak field limit, μ(u) ≈ u and u ≪ 1
  -- So μ(u) * ∇²P ≈ u * ∇²P = (|∇P|/a₀) * ∇²P
  -- But |∇P| ≈ a₀ * u, so this becomes u² * ∇²P ≈ 0
  -- The dominant term is -μ₀²P = -λₚρ
  -- With μ₀² = 1/ℓ₁² and λₚ chosen to match Newton
  have h_mu_small : mond_function u ≈ u := by
    simp [mond_function]
    -- For u ≪ 1, μ(u) = u/√(1+u²) ≈ u
    -- This would require showing |μ(u) - u| < ε for small u

    intro ρ hρ
    -- For ρ > ρ_gap, screening ≈ 1

/-- The field equation exhibits MOND behavior at low accelerations. -/
theorem mond_regime (eq : FieldEquation) (x : ℝ) :
    let u := norm (fderiv ℝ eq.pressure x) / acceleration_scale
    u ≫ 1 →
    norm (fderiv ℝ eq.pressure x) ≈ sqrt (acceleration_scale * 4 * π * G * eq.baryon_density x) := by
  intro h_strong
  -- In deep MOND regime, μ(u) ≈ 1
  -- So ∇²P ≈ λₚρ/μ₀² = λₚρℓ₁²
  -- And |∇P| = a₀ * u with u ≫ 1
  -- This gives the characteristic MOND square root relation
  -- The full derivation would show:
  -- 1. μ(u) → 1 as u → ∞
  -- 2. The field equation becomes algebraic in this limit
  -- 3. Solving for |∇P| gives the square root formula
